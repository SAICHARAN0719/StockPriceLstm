# StockPriceLstm
This notebook provides an in-depth exploration of time series data from the stock market, focusing on technology stocks: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT). Using the yfinance library, we will analyze stock performance, visualize trends, assess risk, and attempt to predict future stock prices using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models.

Getting the Data
We will use the yfinance library to download stock data from Yahoo Finance. Yahoo Finance provides a rich resource for financial market data.

Analysis
1. Change in Price Over Time
We'll visualize the historical price changes of the selected stocks.

2. Daily Return of the Stock
The daily return can be calculated as follows:


3. Moving Average of the Stocks
The moving average smooths out price data:


4. Correlation Between Different Stocks
Correlation helps us understand how stocks move in relation to each other.


5. Risk Assessment
We can quantify risk using the standard deviation of daily returns.

6. Predicting Future Stock Behavior
We will use an LSTM model to predict future stock prices.

Conclusion
In this notebook, we explored and analyzed stock data using the yfinance library. We visualized stock performance, assessed risks, and measured correlations among different stocks. Finally, we introduced predictive modeling using LSTM.
